This repo contains code for the coursework of the module Wavelets, Representation Learning and their Applications.
This is a MATLAB Mini-Project titled "Sampling Signals with Finite Rate of Innovation with an Application to Image Super-Resolution"

Each folder contains code for each of the 8 exercises. Note that the files titled "exn_exploration" are based on the files titled "exn" in the same folder but modified to produce further results.
